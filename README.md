## Description 🌿

YesToPlants is a plant sales web application whose creation was fueled by several key motivations and identified needs of the online plant sales market.

#### History 📅

Historically, the online sales industry has been dominated by general purpose e-commerce platforms that, while versatile, often lacked the specialized approach needed for niche markets such as plant sales.
The app was inspired by a love of nature and a desire to make quality plants available to everyone.

#### Needs 🛍️

- Variety: Shoppers often find it difficult to find a wide range of plant species in one place
- Expertise: Many online shoppers lack knowledge about caring for different plant species.
- Convenience: Traditional garden stores can be too complicated and time-consuming.

#### Our goal 🌸

So, with the growing popularity of indoor gardening and the increasing demand for unique and rare plant species, there is a clear gap in the market, our team aims to not only fill this niche and meet the demand, but also exceed customers' expectations!

Our technology stack includes `TypeScript` for type safety, `Vite` for fast development, `Vitest` for testing, `React` and `Redux` for state management, `React Router` for navigation, `ESLint` and `Prettier` for code quality, and `SASS` for styling, creating a powerful and efficient foundation for our application.

## Getting started 🛠️

To work with the application, you should follow the steps below:

## Scripts 📁

Below are the scripts available for running and managing project. Each script is designed to streamline specific tasks, from development and building to linting and testing.

- `npm run dev` — starts the development server using `Vite`

- `npm run build` — compiles the `TypeScript` code and builds the project using `Vite`, preparing it for production deployment.

- `npm run lint` — runs `ESLint` to check the code for potential errors and style issues, ensuring code quality and adherence to best practices.

- `npm run lint:fix` — automatically fixes many common linting issues, improving code quality without manual intervention.

- `npm run format` — uses `Prettier` to automatically format the codebase

- `npm run preview` — launches a local preview of the built project using `Vite`

- `npm run test` — executes tests written with `Vitest`

- `npm run prepare` — sets up `Husky`
