## Description 🌿

YesToPlants is a plant sales web application whose creation was fueled by several key motivations and identified needs of the online plant sales market.

#### History 📅

Historically, the online sales industry has been dominated by general purpose e-commerce platforms that, while versatile, often lacked the specialized approach needed for niche markets such as plant sales.
The app was inspired by a love of nature and a desire to make quality plants available to everyone.

#### Needs 🛍️

- Variety: Shoppers often find it difficult to find a wide range of plant species in one place
- Expertise: Many online shoppers lack knowledge about caring for different plant species.
- Convenience: Traditional garden stores can be too complicated and time-consuming.

#### Our goal 🌸

So, with the growing popularity of indoor gardening and the increasing demand for unique and rare plant species, there is a clear gap in the market, our team aims to not only fill this niche and meet the demand, but also exceed customers' expectations!
